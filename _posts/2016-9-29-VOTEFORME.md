Hello Covington,


VOTE FOR ME!!! I will be a great student council member if I get voted through. My speech will be outstanding, and I will follow up on that greatness. I will be handing out stickers at the 4-6 grade tables shortly. See you there! Hope you vote for me. By the way, root beer will not come out of the faucets if you vote for me. Thank you!

Matthew
