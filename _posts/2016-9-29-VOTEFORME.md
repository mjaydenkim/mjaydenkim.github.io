Hi Covington, 

VOTE FOR ME!!! I will be a great student council member if I get voted through, and I am a complete package with everything except for the old 
kitchen sink. My speech will be outstanding, and I will follow up on that. I will be handing out stickers and buttons at the 4-6 grade tables.
shortly. See you there! Hope you vote for me. By the way, root beer will not come out of the faucets if you vote for me.

Matthew
